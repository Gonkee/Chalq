trace bezier paths like after effects

stroke styles = solid, dashed, dotted

figure out the rotation (clockwise / counter, where is 0 rotation, rad / deg) - arcs

circle
text object

use text as svg instead
- text blurry right now
- adds rotation functionality
- can scale x & y independently
- allows 3D text


change graph plotter functionality to not rely on Cq

have abstract/generic graph class for line graphs and function graphs

function graph smoothing

video encoding with better quality and on separate thread

vector fields, particle systems
axes for vector and particle fields

have a GraphSpace class which you can add lines, functions, vectors, particles etc to
- with its own set of axis, and stuff are abstract so they can be 2d or 3d

move pop up / trace functions from Scene to Object?

bounded interface for objects that have x, y, width, height, for easy centering and alignment

shapes objects are sketchy, must formalize properties in class hierarchy and separate outline objects not always updated

standardise object color property

clean up functions in vector classes
