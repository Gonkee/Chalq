- make everything into "drawable" objects which hold their own attributes
- scale, rotation, translation, etc for drawables
- "traceable" paths that can draw a path up to a certain percentage (supports basic paths like lines, arcs)

path components:
- line
- circle
- arc

trace bezier paths like after effects

make TracePath follow Object2D scale, translation, rotation, etc
generalise tracepath workflow to all polygons etc, not just rectangle
