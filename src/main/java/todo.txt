- make everything into "drawable" objects which hold their own attributes
- scale, rotation, translation, etc for drawables
- "traceable" paths that can draw a path up to a certain percentage (supports basic paths like lines, arcs)

path components:
- line
- circle
- arc

trace bezier paths like after effects

make TracePath follow Object2D scale, translation, rotation, etc
generalise tracepath workflow to all polygons etc, not just rectangle

which are just the nvg functions but with vectors gone through local to global space transform
