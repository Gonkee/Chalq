- "traceable" paths that can draw a path up to a certain percentage (supports basic paths like lines, arcs)

path components:
- line
- circle
- arc

trace bezier paths like after effects

make TracePath follow Object2D scale, translation, rotation, etc
generalise tracepath workflow to all polygons etc, not just rectangle

##################
localToGlobal function - used for all penXXX functions (e.g. penBeginPath, penLineTo)
which are just the nvg functions but with vectors gone through local to global space transform
###############

maybe use a "Traceable" interface for the tracing functionality, instead of in Shape2D,
so that other stuff like graph plotters can be traced too?

only allow interpolation of specific attributes to remove the need of mutable scalars?

use matrix? to be able to get scale, rotation, translation separately

ArcPath class for arrows etc.

add delay option for showing objects

position of an object should be unknown to itself, but known only to its parent
- position should never be used when drawing locally / dealing with local space

figure out the rotation (clockwise / counter, where is 0 rotation, rad / deg) - arcs
